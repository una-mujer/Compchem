**Computational Chemistry for Catalyst Upcycling**
This repository contains Python scripts and workflows developed as part of a group research project under the supervision of PHD Assistant Professor Anukriti Shrestha in Incubate Nepal, focused on identifying efficient catalysts for polymer upcycling using computational chemistry methods.
Our team at [Compchem](https://compchem.co/) is dedicated to addressing the global plastic pollution crisis by developing advanced upcycling methods. Utilizing computational chemistry, we screened and modeled various catalysts to find efficient and sustainable solutions for breaking down plastic waste. This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of plastic recycling processes through the identification of optimal catalytic pathways.
